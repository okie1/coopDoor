# Coop Keeper 5000
This project documents an automatic chicken coop door.

## Overview
Once I started raising chickens on my farm out in the country, I discovered how many different varmints liked to help themselves to my chickens. After several catastrophic loses, I developed a habit of walking out to my chicken coop at dark to make sure my chickens were shut up securely inside the coop. The next morning, I would walk back out to the coop to let the chickens back out of their coop. Rinse and repeat, day after day, week after week. As much as I loved raising chickens, the routine got old fast. So, I decided to try to develop an automatic way to do this. I ended up building an automated chicken door that would open and close based on the outside light levels. The door would shut each evening and open again the next morning. Because it used light instead of a timer, the door would stay open longer in the summers and not as long in the winters.
